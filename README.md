# Covid-19 Cases at Georgia Tech Visualization
A shiny app to track the covid-19 cases at Georgia Tech. Originally, Tech's covid tracker did not include visuals. They have since updated their website. 

The app can be viewed at https://freyja.shinyapps.io/GATech_Covid_Visualization/ or using shiny::runGitHub.
